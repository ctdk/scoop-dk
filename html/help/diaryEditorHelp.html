<p>Publishing your own Diaries on Daily Kos is a snap. You can type or
paste plain text or HTML, and there are several helpful features you can
use:</p>
<p>Select text you have typed, and use the <strong>Bold</strong> and <strong>Italic</strong>
buttons to format them. You may also create the "cool gray box" around
quoted text via the <strong>Blockquote</strong> button...this will also
copy text into a blockquote you have selected elsewhere on this page.</p>
<p>Adding links to other pages is easy as well. Click on the <strong>Link</strong>
button and you can enter a URL and an optional label for the link. Then
click <strong>Add</strong> to add it. Checking the <strong>Image</strong>
box will insert an image stored at that URL, with the label visible on
mouseover. Clicking <strong>Link</strong> again will cancel adding a
link.</p>
<p>There are plenty of helpful shortcuts you can use without clicking on
buttons. Placing a URL inside square brackets like this: <strong>[http://www.dailykos.com
Daily Kos]</strong> will result in a link with any added words as a
label. <strong>[[Double Brackets]]</strong> creates a link to the entry
for that term in <a href="http://www.dkosopedia.com"
  title="The Daily Kos Political Encyclopedia">Dkosopedia</a>.</p>
<p>Starting a line with <strong>1.</strong> or <strong>3)</strong> or
even <strong>#</strong>, followed by a space, will result in a list item
with that or an automatically selected numeral, and <strong>*</strong>
will provide a bullet list item. Surrounding words or sentences with
certain characters makes things *<strong>bold</strong>* _<em>italic</em>_
/<em>also italic</em>/ -<del>struckout</del>- and there are others. If
you wish to defeat this formatting, simply precede the special character
with a backslash (<strong>\</strong>), e.g. \*not bold*.</p>
<p>When you've got everything the way you want it, click <strong>Preview
Diary</strong> to get a Preview of your whole diary as it will appear
when published. If you need to make a change, any of the <strong>Edit
Diary</strong> links will bring back the editors.</p>
<p><strong>Once you are satisfied with your diary, you must click
Publish to post it.</strong> Otherwise your Diary (or changes to it)
will not be posted. You can always edit it at any time by clicking one
of the <strong>Edit Diary</strong> links to bring back the editors.</p>
<p>Should you accidentally close your web browser while editing a diary,
don't panic! Daily Kos saves drafts of your diaries behind the scenes.
The drafts will appear in the <strong>Diary Drafts</strong> menu
until they are either Published or Deleted. To delete a diary, whether
published or not, click the <strong>Delete</strong> button.</p>
<p>Clicking <strong>Help</strong> again will hide this information.
